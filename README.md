# fastai_nano

This repository contains instructions for setting up a Jetson Nano to run fastai (and therefore PyTorch and Jupyter Notebook).
It is based on the post by 

Eventually, my goal is to create a distribution for the Jetson (Nano and others) which you can use in a single step, rather than replicating all the installation steps.

The first attempt yields a working fastai installation.

## Known issues
I could not successfully install the `fastcourse` library. Therefore you cannot yet run the notebooks from the fastai course as they currently require this library.
